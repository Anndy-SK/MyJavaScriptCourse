-> Lecture: Data Types:
    The 7 primitive data types:
        1. Number:  Floating point numbers -> used for decimals and integers, ->>  let age = 23;
        2. String:  Sequence of characters -> used for text, ->>  let firstName = 'Jonas';
        3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be "true" or "false" -> used for taking decision, ->> let fullAge = true;
        4. Undefined:   Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value'), ->> let children
        5. Null:        Also means 'empty value'
        6. Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed [Not useful for now]
        7. BigInt (ES2020): Larger integers than the Number type can hold

> JavaScript has dynamic typing, data types are determined automatically.
> operator "typeof", ->> console.log(typeof true);
